        <p> Getting the proper sleep can boost your immune system.
            When a human body gets the sleep it needs, the
            immune cells and proteins get the rest they need
            to fight off sickness like the flu or the
            common cold at a more efficient rate.</p>
  
        <p> Sleeping the recommended amount of 6-8 hours,
            can help fight adding on body fat. If an
            Individual does not get enough sleep, their
            body produces ghrelin, a hormone that boosts
            appetite. The body also decreases the production
            of leptin, a hormone that tells you that you
            are full. If you add both of these together
            it can become a dangerous combination for
            binge eating. With this being said, when you
            dont sleep enough the chances of you becoming
            more stressed are higher and you don't have
            the energy to fight off junk food cravings.
        </p>
  
  
  
        <p> Not getting enough sleep can lead to
            heart problems like high blood pressure
            or heart attacks. Thats because lack of
            sleep can cause your body to release
            cortisol, a stress hormone that triggers
            your heart to work harder. Just like your
            immune system, your heart needs rest in
            order to function powerfully and
            properly. Just another reason to “heart”
            sleep.

         <h2>Mind</h2>
            <p> Memory can be broken down into two categories;
                procedural and declarative. Procedural memory 
                is the ability to recall how to perform different
                actions and skills, like cooking a recipe or riding
                a bike. Declarative memory is the ability to recall 
                specific information like names, dates, and facts. 
                According to many studies, sleep allows the brain to 
                restore and retain those memories. 
            </p>

            <p> The brain has a method for removing toxins and
                 waste during sleep. Scientists call this process
                the glymphatic system. The long term benefits
                of this unique process is quite amazing. The
                glymphatic system helps eliminate the possibility
                of Alzheimer's and other neurological disorders.
                During the sleeping phase, the brain cells can 
                also reduce in size which allows the glymphatic 
                system to work more efficiently.
