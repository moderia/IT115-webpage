    <p> Getting the proper sleep can boost your immune system.
        When a human body gets the sleep it needs, the
        immune cells and proteins get the rest they need
        to fight off sickness like the flu or the
        common cold at a more efficient rate.</p>

    <p> Sleeping the recommended amount of 6-8 hours,
        can help fight adding on body fat. If an
        Individual does not get enough sleep, their
        body produces ghrelin, a hormone that boosts
        appetite. The body also decreases the production
        of leptin, a hormone that tells you that you
        are full. If you add both of these together
        it can become a dangerous combination for
        binge eating. With this being said, when you
        dont sleep enough the chances of you becoming
        more stressed are higher and you don't have
        the energy to fight off junk food cravings.
    </p>



    <p> Not getting enough sleep can lead to
        heart problems like high blood pressure
        or heart attacks. Thats because lack of
        sleep can cause your body to release
        cortisol, a stress hormone that triggers
        your heart to work harder. Just like your
        immune system, your heart needs rest in
        order to function powerfully and
        properly. Just another reason to “heart”
        sleep.
